# Recipes

Recipes is a drag and drop application where you can add, edit and delete recipes of yours.

This application was developed in Vue 3 with TypeScript using the Composition API, along with Bootstrap and Pinia for state management. I structured the application into reusable, medium-sized components, and it is responsive thanks to Bootstrap. The UI/UX design was created by me using Figma.


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
